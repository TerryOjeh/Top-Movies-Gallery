# Movie-React-Project
1. Interactive web application that allows users to browse and search for movies, view detailed information, and save favorites.
2. Utilized the TMDB API to fetch real-time movie data, including titles, descriptions, ratings, and posters.
3. Developed a dynamic frontend using React, implementing reusable components such as movie cards, search bars, and pagination for an enhanced user experience.
4. Integrated state management with React's Context API to manage user-selected favorites across the app.
5. Styled the application using CSS for a clean and responsive design across devices.
