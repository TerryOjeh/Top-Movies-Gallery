# Movie-React-Project
Interactive web application that allows users to browse and search for movies, view detailed information, and save favorites.
Utilized the TMDB API to fetch real-time movie data, including titles, descriptions, ratings, and posters.
Developed a dynamic frontend using React, implementing reusable components such as movie cards, search bars, and pagination for an enhanced user experience.
Integrated state management with React's Context API to manage user-selected favorites across the app.
Styled the application using CSS for a clean and responsive design across devices.
